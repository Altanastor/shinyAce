{"name":"shinyAce","tagline":"Integrating the Ace Editor with Shiny","body":"shinyAce\r\n==========\r\n\r\nThe `shinyAce` package enables Shiny application developers to use the \r\n[Ace text editor](http://ace.c9.io/#nav=about) in their applications. All\r\ncurrent modes (languages) and themes are supported in this package. The \r\nmode, theme, and current text can be defined when the element is initialized \r\nin `ui.R` or afterwards using the `updateAceEditor()` function. The editor\r\nregisters itself as a reactive Shiny input, so the current value of the\r\neditor can easily be pulled from `server.R` using `input$yourEditorsName`.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nYou can install the latest version of the code using the `devtools` R package.\r\nThis package uses a new proposed feature in Shiny which must be specifically\r\ninstalled, as well.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Install devtools, if you haven't already.\r\ninstall.packages(\"devtools\")\r\n\r\nlibrary(devtools)\r\ninstall_github(\"shinyAce\", \"trestletech\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThe development of this project was generously sponsored by the [Institut de \r\nRadioprotection et de Sûreté Nucléaire](http://www.irsn.fr/EN/Pages/home.aspx) \r\nand performed by [Jeff Allen](http://trestletech.com).
